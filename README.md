# Telemetry

Telemetry is a set of code supporting individual modules tied to a hardware platform. This project currently contains two hardware platforms:

* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware)
* [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)

The modules attached to these hardware platforms help to collect and store certain information during the high altitude balloon's travel. Each set of set is structure to support individual lessons shared in a learning session with students or other groups of individuals.
