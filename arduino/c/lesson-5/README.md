# Welcome to Lesson #5: Storing the data

## Working with SD card using the Arduino language
<br>

#### Pre-requisites:
- It is recommended that you have successfully completed the [blinky lights lesson](../lesson-1/)
<br><br>

#### Objectives:
- Breadboard a circuit
- Read and write from the SD card that is wired up to the Arduino 
<br><br>

#### What you will be using:
- [Arduino IDE](screenshots/arduino-ide.png)
- [Arduino Uno](screenshots/arduino-uno-r3.png)
- [MicroSD Card Module](../lesson-1/photos/sd_card_module.jpg)
- [Breadboard](screenshots/breadboard.png)
- [Wires](../lesson-3/screenshots/1956-02.jpg)
<br><br>

#### What you will be learning:
- How to connect the SD card to the Arduino using a breadboard
- How to create a new Arduino Sketch project using the SDI Library
- Write the code in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino
  - Create a file on the SD card
  - Write some data to the SD card
- Watch your code run on the Arduino using Arduino IDE's serial monitor
<br><br>

### Video Walk-through
In addition to the reading below, you can watch this [video](videos/Lesson5.mp4?raw=true) for guidance!
<br><br>

<!-- ## Guide
Read this article  and follow the steps
- [SD Card Module with Arduino: How to Read/Write Data](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/electropeak/sd-card-module-with-arduino-how-to-read-write-data-37f390)
<br><br> -->

### Wiring
- **Unplug the Arduino from the computer before doing this**

### Pinout chart
Pin on SD card reader | Pin on Arduino  
------ | ------
GND   | GND  
VCC   | 5V  
MISO   | 12  
MOSI   | 11  
SCK   | 13  
CS   | 10

- Remember you do not have to use the same color of jumper wire as this, but insure that your connections are the same. 
<br><br>

**You are welcome to use the bread board as well to wire everything up.**

## Formatting the SD Card
The SD card module works with a maximum of 32GB. This means you can either use a 32GB card or partition a larger card with a smaller drive. You can use the disk management application availble on Windows OS to do this function.<br><br>
***NOTICE:*** Use caution with this tool as it can alter your boot drive as well.

#### Working code to test SD card
```
#include <SPI.h>
#include <SD.h>

File myFile;

void setup() {
  // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);

  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }

  Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");
  if (!SD.begin(10)) {
    Serial.println("initialization failed!");
    while (1);
  }
  Serial.println("initialization done.");

  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
  // so you have to close this one before opening another.
  myFile = SD.open("test.txt", FILE_WRITE);
  // if the file opened okay, write to it:
  if (myFile) {
    Serial.print("Writing to test.txt...");
    myFile.println("This is a test file :)");
    myFile.println("testing 1, 2, 3.");

    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
      myFile.println(i);
    }

    // close the file:
    myFile.close();
    Serial.println("done.");
  } else {
    // if the file didn't open, print an error:
    Serial.println("error opening test.txt");
  }
}
void loop() {
  // nothing happens after setup
}
```

### Review
- Learned how to connect the SD card to the Arduino using a breadboard
- How to create a new Arduino Sketch project using the SDI Library
  - Create a file on the SD card
  - Write some data to the SD card

## Want more?
If you have finished with the base lesson, check out the items below.
<br><br>

Things to think about, validate, and/or try:
* How big is the file?
* Is CSV the best output format?
* How long before we run out of space on the SD card? ðŸ¤”

Update the code to do any/all of the following:
1. Write your own custom output to the file and change the filename
1. Use a loop to write the even numbers from 0 to 100 into the file ðŸ˜µ
<br><br>

### Troubleshooting
- If using a SD card larger that 32gb partitioning down to 32gb or less and formatting to fat32 may be required
- If the SD card is not registering check all your connections first, if this doesn't work insure that the card is empty and formatted to fat 32
