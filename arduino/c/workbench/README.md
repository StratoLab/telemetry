Remixed off the Frog Box by Nibb31: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4094861  

We adjusted the size for our needs and added the ability to hold a arduino in the base for safe storage of the student project and parts.

Parts required to assemble:  
* 8 [M3 x 20mm screws](https://www.amazon.com/M3-0-5-Button-Socket-Screws-Quantity/dp/B083HR5HZ9)  

Parts required to hold arduino:
* 4 [M2 x 5mm self tapping screws](https://www.amazon.com/100Pcs-Phillips-Tapping-Screws-Carbon/dp/B07ZGDNDGJ)

Parts required to hold breadboard:

Snug tighten each screw, do not overtighten or it'll strip out the plastic and no longer hold.
